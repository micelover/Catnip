This is the main loop file for our AutoTube Bot!

Quick notes!
- Currently it's set to try and post a video then sleep for a day.
- You can change the size of the video currently it's set to post shorts.
    * Do this by adding a parameter of scale to the image_save function.
    * scale=(width,height)
